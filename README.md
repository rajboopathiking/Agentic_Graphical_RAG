# 🤖 Agentic + Graphical RAG  
*A Unified Architecture for Structured Reasoning, Knowledge Grounding & Intelligent Retrieval*

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of an **Agentic Graphical RAG** system — a hybrid architecture that combines:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Knowledge Graph / Graph RAG reasoning
- Agent-based decision orchestration
- Iterative reasoning + planning pipeline

The goal of this work is to move beyond traditional vanilla RAG systems and demonstrate how **agents + knowledge structure + retrieval** together create a more *reliable, interpretable and controllable AI system*.

## 🚀 Core Contribution
Unlike traditional RAG, Graph RAG, or Agentic systems used separately, this work:

✔ Integrates **Agents + Graph Reasoning + Retrieval** into a single workflow  
✔ Uses **graph structure** to enhance context selection and reasoning accuracy  
✔ Enables **iterative self-correction and decision autonomy**  
✔ Provides **explainable reasoning paths** rather than black-box responses  
✔ Demonstrates **methodological + technical novelty**, not just application-level usage

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### 🔹 1️⃣ Knowledge Layer
Stores information in a structured relational form enabling:
- entity linking  
- relationship inference  
- graph traversal retrieval  
- structured knowledge reasoning  

### 🔹 2️⃣ Retrieval Layer
Performs:
- semantic document search
- graph neighborhood expansion
- hybrid RAG retrieval strategy

### 🔹 3️⃣ Agent Layer
Agents coordinate reasoning:
- Planner Agent → decides approach
- Retriever Agent → fetches knowledge
- Graph Reasoning Agent → performs relational logic
- Synthesizer Agent → composes final response

### 🔹 4️⃣ Inference Layer
Produces:
- grounded answers
- graph-aware reasoning
- reliable contextual responses
