# 🤖 Agentic Graphical RAG  
*A Unified Architecture for Structured Reasoning, Knowledge Grounding & Intelligent Retrieval*

**Agentic_Graphical_RAG** showcases a hybrid AI architecture combining:

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Knowledge Graph / Graph-RAG reasoning  
- Agent-based workflow orchestration  
- Unified multimodal + structured reasoning pipeline  

This project moves beyond traditional RAG by integrating **agents + structured knowledge + intelligent retrieval**, enabling systems that are **more reliable, interpretable, and controllable**.

## 🚀 Core Contributions

Unlike traditional RAG, Graph-RAG, or Agentic pipelines used separately, this project:

- ✔ Integrates **Agents + Graph Reasoning + RAG Retrieval** in one workflow  
- ✔ Utilizes **graph structure** to enhance grounding & retrieval accuracy  
- ✔ Supports **iterative planning and self-correction**  
- ✔ Produces **transparent reasoning paths** instead of black-box responses  
- ✔ Demonstrates **true methodological + technical innovation**

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### 🔹 1️⃣ Knowledge Layer
Stores structured relational knowledge supporting:
- Entity linking  
- Relationship inference  
- Graph traversal  
- Structured reasoning  

---

### 🔹 2️⃣ Retrieval Layer
Performs:
- Semantic document search  
- Graph neighborhood expansion  
- Hybrid RAG retrieval  

---

### 🔹 3️⃣ Agent Layer
Coordinates intelligent reasoning through:
- **Planner Agent** → decides reasoning strategy  
- **Retriever Agent** → fetches supporting knowledge  
- **Graph Reasoning Agent** → performs relational reasoning  
- **Synthesizer Agent** → constructs grounded response  

---

### 🔹 4️⃣ Inference Layer
Produces outputs that are:
- Knowledge-grounded  
- Graph-aware  
- Contextually reliable
